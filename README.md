# Calorie Tracker

## Description

This is a simple Java program that tracks calorie intake and calories burned over 7 days. It calculates total and average values and determines if the user has gained or lost weight based on calorie balance.

## How It Works

The user enters calories consumed and burned for each day.
The program calculates:

* Total calories consumed and burned for the week.
* Average daily calorie intake and burn.
* Net weekly weight change (in pounds).
* The results are displayed to the user.
